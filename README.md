# AlgAssignment1
Submission for assignment 1 in the Design of Algorithms subject COMP20007 at The University of Melbourne

This assignment required students to complete a series of questions. The assignment can be separated into two parts.

The first part involved implementing three functions in an already created deque as listed below:
1. Iterative reverse
2. Recursive reverse
3. Split deque

The second part involved a problem in which there is a directed acyclic graph. The root of the graph is the top of a mountain, and all other nodes are "trees". A treecutter will start at the top of the mountain and need to cut all trees in a single run. The algorithm implemented determines if such a run is possible.
